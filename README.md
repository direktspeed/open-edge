# open-edge
Peer-to-peer serverless infrastructure, powered by open-pwa technology and built using the spare capacity all around us. The Future of the Cloud Is Edge.

# What Is Edge Networking?
Edge networking is a distributed computing paradigm which brings data storage and computation as close to the point of need as possible, pushing applications, data and computing power away from centralized data centers.

This reduces the volumes of data that must be moved, the consequent traffic, and the distance the data must travel, providing lower latency and reduced transmission costs.

# Edge Compute Units
Like a virtual machine, but hyper localized. The containerised application layer on the Edge enables you to deploy your applications like never before, with a real-time distribution matrix that automatically deploys and scales, based on demand.

Edge dynamically manages the allocation of machine resources, and pricing is based on the actual amount of resources consumed by your app.





The key strengths and advantages of Edge noted by the judging panel were:

- Overall effect of increasing speed and efficiency in a wide range of applications.
- Network coverage.
- The fact that anyone with a laptop, mobile or any connected device can earn money and help people by supplying spare computational and storage capacity to the network.
- This is a prime product, for sectors such as smart manufacturing and smart cities.
- The business model leverages existing connected devices to provide computational power that can be monetised was seen as a huge plus.
